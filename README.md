# chibitales.org - Milestone Project 2 - Interactive Frontend Development
While the first chibitales.org Milestone Project aimed to create an easy to use websites providing all relevant information to successfully play the game Chibi Fighters 2.0, the version intends to deliver interactivity to the website.

As a player, the thing you are probably missing most is a central point where you can find statistics about the game's content. Whilemost of this information is available it is located in different locations and it is hard to get an overview.

This project will collect the available information from two Chibi Fighters APIs and combine it with manually added information, giving players a source to find all available statistics regarding the game.

Via an email service integration it will be possible to contact the developer and potentially sign up for a newsletter.

## UX
The new interactive section on chibitales.org will give players and potential players the opportunity to browse the game cards and their statistical information.

To get an impression on the planned visualization, take a look into the mockUps folder. There will be three different user stories for this section: 

* For users who want to get a visual and information on a specific card: Searching card-information by card-name

* For users who want to get a visual and information on a specific card: Searching card-information by card-number

* For users who want to see a collection of card-types: Searching by selecting one to four card-features
